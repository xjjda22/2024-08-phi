## Summary
An overview of the findings, including the number of vulnerabilities identified and a brief description of the overall security posture.

### 1. **Cred.sol**
- **Summary**: The `Cred.sol` contract manages the creation and trade of credentials (`creds`). This contract includes functions for buying, selling, and managing creds, with features for pausing operations and upgrading the contract.
- **Vulnerability Details**:
  
  - **Reentrancy Risk**: SWC-107: The `buyShareCred` and `sellShareCred` functions involve external calls to transfer funds, which might lead to reentrancy attacks.
    **Severity**: High
  
    ```solidity
    function buyShareCred(uint256 credId_, uint256 amount_, uint256 maxPrice_) public payable {
        // ...
        // External call to transfer funds
        payable(seller).transfer(cost);
        // ...
    }
    ```
    **Line**: 182
  
  - **Unchecked Call Return Values**: SWC-104: Functions that interact with external contracts should check the return values of `transfer` and other low-level calls.
    **Severity**: Medium
  
    ```solidity
    payable(seller).transfer(cost);
    ```
    **Line**: 182
  
  - **Missing Input Validation**: SWC-128: The `createCred` function accepts input without proper validation, such as ensuring non-zero addresses.
    **Severity**: Medium
  
    ```solidity
    function createCred(
        address creator_,
        bytes calldata signedData_,
        bytes calldata signature_,
        uint16 buyShareRoyalty_,
        uint16 sellShareRoyalty_
    ) public {
        // ...
    }
    ```
    **Line**: 232
  
  - **Centralization Risk**: SWC-114: The contract owner has significant power, including setting fees and managing the whitelist, leading to potential misuse if compromised.
    **Severity**: Medium
  
    ```solidity
    function setPhiSignerAddress(address phiSignerAddress_) external nonZeroAddress(phiSignerAddress_) onlyOwner {
        phiSignerAddress = phiSignerAddress_;
        emit PhiSignerAddressSet(phiSignerAddress_);
    }
    ```
    **Line**: 129

- **Impact**: These vulnerabilities could lead to unauthorized fund transfers, incorrect contract behavior, or a single point of failure due to centralized control.
- **Tools Used**: Manual code inspection, Slither.
- **Recommendations**:
  - **Reentrancy Fix**: Use the `ReentrancyGuard` modifier to prevent reentrancy attacks.
    ```solidity
    import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";
    ```
  - **Unchecked Call Fix**: Ensure that external calls check return values and handle errors appropriately.
    ```solidity
    require(payable(seller).send(cost), "Transfer failed");
